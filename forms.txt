Forms are used to collect users data. Angular handles the forms in two ways
  i. template forms: these forms are created using template code(html).
  ii. reactive forms : these form are created using component code(ts), also called component forms

  i. Template Driven Forms:
   Every form element like input,buttons etc.., are instances of formControl. formControl instances contains properties like pristine,dirty,valid,invalid,required etc..,
   These forms supports two way data binding using ngModel directive
   To handle inputs and forms we use formControl and formGroup

   touched: true when user click atleast once on that input(select)
   unTouched: true when user doesn;t click/select the input
   pristine: true when user did not changed previous value
   dirty: true when user  changed the previous value
   valid: true when there are no errors fo rinput validation
   invalid: true when there are errors
